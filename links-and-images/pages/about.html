        This is the about section that is supposed to let you know more about me. Sadly, you should have
        realized by now that I have nothing to say about me. I guess that is one thing you have found out
        about me already. I mean how can an <em>About</em> section not contain anything about the author.
        I guess the only thing that can make this an about page is the number of times about is written in
        this about page. How about that?
